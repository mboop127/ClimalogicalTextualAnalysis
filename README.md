# ClimalogicalTextualAnalysis

This tool will count the words written in the "word-list.txt" file and output the counts to a .csv. 

Input the words in the following format: 
  word1, word2, word3, etc.
  
Be sure to include all variations of the spelling, or they will not be counted.

In order to count words in one ore more texts, place them as unicode-8 txt files in a new folder titled "books." Without this new folder, the program will not run.

You may put as many or ass few texts in the "books" folder as you choose. Word counts for each will be printed with the document title and two lines separating them.
